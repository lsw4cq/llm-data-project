Scope: I am doing a semantics model to predict if the semantic is positive or negative using the IMDB dataset. 

Data: So far data is straightforward. There needs to be removal of characters and stop words. There are a lot of upper/lower case reviews and ***** etc. 

First Model Results: 
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.75      0.70      0.72      2529
           1       0.71      0.76      0.73      2471

    accuracy                           0.73      5000
   macro avg       0.73      0.73      0.73      5000
weighted avg       0.73      0.73      0.73      5000

I used tfidf and then went with a LogisticRegression and the results are above.
